# 🖖 Trekkie - The Ultimate Star Trek Timeline Tracker

> *"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages... of someone trying to watch 800+ episodes and 13 movies in the right order without losing their mind."*

**Trekkie** is a Flutter app that boldly goes where no Star Trek viewing guide has gone before! Finally, you can experience all of Star Trek in proper **chronological order** based on the in-universe timeline, not when your parents were young and thought special effects meant painted ping-pong balls.

## 🚀 Features That Would Make Data Jealous

### 📊 **Recommended Viewing Order**
Tired of watching Picard as a young man after seeing him as an old Admiral? Our expert-curated viewing guide organizes everything into six logical eras, so you can experience Star Trek as it was meant to be seen (chronologically speaking, not release-wise, because that would be chaos).

### 👨‍✈️ **Captain Portraits** 
Each series displays the name of its commanding officer because let's face it - half the fun is seeing how much better (or worse) each captain's hair looks compared to Kirk's perfect coif.

### 📚 **Complete Episode Database**
All **800+ episodes** from every Star Trek series, complete with:
- Accurate stardates (when they make sense)
- Air dates (when humanity still thought Y2K would end civilization)
- Episode summaries (spoiler-free, unlike your friend who ruins everything)

### 🎬 **Movies Integration**
All **13 Star Trek movies** including:
- The TOS era films (where Shatner's acting gets progressively more... Shatner)
- The TNG movies (where Data's emotion chip causes more drama than a Kardashian reality show)
- The Kelvin timeline reboot trilogy (where everything is shinier and has more lens flares)

### ✅ **Watch Tracking**
- Mark episodes and movies as watched with timestamps
- Because how else will you prove to your friends that you actually sat through "Spock's Brain"?
- Automatic date annotation so you can remember exactly when you questioned your life choices

### ⭐ **Favorites System**
Star your favorite episodes and movies, though we all know "The Inner Light" and "Wrath of Khan" will top everyone's list anyway.

### 📈 **Progress Tracking**
Visual progress indicators show you're slowly becoming the Trekkie you always knew you were, complete with:
- Series completion percentages
- Overall franchise progress
- A growing sense of superiority over people who think Star Wars is better

### 📊 **Statistics Dashboard**
Detailed stats that answer burning questions like:
- How many hours of your life you've devoted to Star Trek
- Which captain you've spent the most time with (spoiler: it's probably Picard)
- Whether you've watched more episodes about time travel than actual time you've spent time traveling (hint: yes)

### 🔮 **API Integration Ready**
Built to integrate with Star Trek APIs because even in the 24th century, data synchronization is important.

## 🌌 The Six Eras of Star Trek (Or: How to Watch 800+ Episodes Without Crying)

Our viewing guide is organized into six distinct eras, each with its own flavor of scientific impossibilities and inspiring moral lessons:

- **Star Trek Into Darkness** - Khan returns with better abs and more complicated motivations  
- **Star Trek Beyond** - The crew learns that unity beats nihilism (shocking!)

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Live Long and Install)

### 🔧 **For Developers** 
*(Because even starship engineers need to debug their code)*

1. **Install Flutter** (if you haven't already fallen down this rabbit hole)
2. **Clone this repository** to your local machine (or your starship's computer core)
3. **Run `flutter pub get`** to download more dependencies than the Enterprise has crew members
4. **Run `flutter run`** and watch the magic happen faster than warp 9

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trekkie.git
cd trekkie
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 🐧 **Linux Installation**
*(Because penguins can be Trekkies too)*

#### **Local Installation** (Current user only - perfect for your personal viewing addiction)
```bash
chmod +x install_local.sh
./install_local.sh
```

#### **System-wide Installation** (All users - spread the Trek love)
```bash
chmod +x install_linux.sh
sudo ./install_linux.sh
```

#### **Uninstallation** (In case you need to go back to a world without proper Star Trek organization)
```bash
chmod +x uninstall_linux.sh
./uninstall_linux.sh
```

After installation, the app will appear in your application menu with the iconic Star Trek delta shield. Launch it from your desktop environment or command line and prepare for the journey of a lifetime.

## 💾 Data Persistence (Your Watching History Won't Disappear Into a Temporal Anomaly)

The app uses SharedPreferences to securely store:
- **Watch status** for all episodes and movies (with timestamps more precise than stardate calculations)
- **Favorite markers** (because everyone needs a list of their top episodes for reference)
- **Watch dates** (so you can remember when you discovered your new favorite episode)
- **Progress tracking** (your journey to becoming the ultimate Trekkie)

Your data persists across app updates, device restarts, and hopefully temporal incursions.

## 🌐 API Integration (The Final Frontier of Real-Time Data)

The app is designed to boldly interface with:

- **STAPI (Star Trek API)**: https://stapi.co/api/v1/rest 
  - The most comprehensive Star Trek database in the known universe
  - More detailed than Memory Alpha, more reliable than the Enterprise computer
  
- **Subspace API**: https://subspaceapi.com 
  - Alternative Star Trek data source for redundancy
  - Because even in the 24th century, you need backup systems

**Fallback System**: The app includes complete static data to ensure functionality even when:
- APIs are down (like the Enterprise computer during a crisis)
- You're exploring offline (like Voyager in the Delta Quadrant)
- The internet has been destroyed by hostile aliens (again)

## 🎬 Complete Movie Collection (All 13 Films, Ranked by Timeline Not Quality)

### 🌌 **TOS Era Movies** (The Original Cast Being Awesome)
1. **The Motion Picture** - Slow but beautiful, like a very expensive screensaver
2. **The Wrath of Khan** - Widely considered the best (and they're right)
3. **The Search for Spock** - The crew steals their own ship (badass!)
4. **The Voyage Home** - Time travel to save whales (no, really)
5. **The Final Frontier** - Spock's brother seeks God (we don't talk about this one much)
6. **The Undiscovered Country** - A perfect send-off for the original crew

8. **First Contact** - The Borg travel back to ruin everything (as usual)
9. **Insurrection** - Picard becomes a rebel (again)
10. **Nemesis** - Evil Picard is just regular Picard having a bad day

11. **Star Trek (2009)** - Young Kirk learns to Kirk properly
12. **Into Darkness** - Khan returns with better workout routine
13. **Beyond** - The crew learns friendship beats nihilism every time
